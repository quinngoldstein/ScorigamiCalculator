# ScorigamiCalculator
Calculator application for Scorigami.

This application calculates the scoring output necessary for a certain score in an NFL game. This calculator was inspired by SB Nation's (Secret Base) Jon Bois' Scorigami. See the links below for more on Scorigami, the art of creating unique NFL scores!

I was inspired to make this program during the 2021-22 NFL season after seeing a few Scorigamis that season and even more of them the season prior. Scorigami mixes two things I enjoy: math and sports. I think that statistics are an interesting thing to consider in sports and wanted to create a sort of program that could piece together how football scores - the weirdest scoring system in all of sports - come together.
